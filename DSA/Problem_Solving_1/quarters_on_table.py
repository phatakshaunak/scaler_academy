Consider a two-player game played on a circular table of unspecified diameter.



Each player has an infinite supply of coins, and take turns placing a coin on the table such that it is completely on the table and does not overlap with any other coins already played.
A player wins if he makes the last legal move.
Which player (if any) has a strategy that will guarantee a win?
Assume that the diameter of the table is greater than the diameter of the coin.
Assume that Player 1 makes the first move.'''
