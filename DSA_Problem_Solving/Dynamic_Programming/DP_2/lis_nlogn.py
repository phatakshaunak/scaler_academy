Problem Description

You are given an array A. You need to find the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence in the array.

In other words, you need to find a subsequence of array A in which the elements are in sorted order, (strictly increasing) and as long as possible.



Problem Constraints

1 ≤ length(A), A[i] ≤ 105



Input Format

The first and only argument of the input is the array A.



Output Format

Output a single integer, the length of the longest increasing subsequence in array A.



Example Input

Input 1:

A: [2, 1, 4, 3]
Input 2:

A: [5, 6, 3, 7, 9]


Example Output

Output 1:

2
Output 2:

4


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 [2, 4] and [1, 3] are the longest increasing sequences of size 2. 
Explanation 2:

The longest increasing subsequence we can get is [5, 6, 7, 9] of size 4.'''
